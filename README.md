LazyBird is a simple game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS where you play as a bird trying to fly through a series of pipes without hitting them. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by successfully passing through as many pipes as you can.
> Made by Therundmc & Weirdaz a FNEK studio GAME

# How to Play
choose your bird ! between LAZY, OLDY, CRAZY ...

Click on the screen to start
